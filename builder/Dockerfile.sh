# VuePress requires node_modules to be in the same directory as the package itself:
# * installing globally with `npm install -g` doesn't install all the dependencies
# * installing elsewhere and symlinking causes errors
# * installing elsewhere and symlinking subdirectories causes errors
# * installing elsewhere and hardlinking works, so long as we're on the same filesystem
# * installing elsewhere and copying works, but is slow
#
# ... so we install elsewher and use `install-directory.sh`
#
# Note: it's possible I've made some silly mistake that causes all of this,
# but I can't get useful guidance or error messages to figure out what.
